## Lina Marea - venezuelan pianist based in Bruselas

**Greetings!** I'm Lina Marea, a passionate piano and musical language teacher based in the picturesque streets and historic architecture of [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels). With a keen ear for beautiful melodies and a love for dramatic interpretations of most of the academic master pieces, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to your concerts or events.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in sharing my passion for piano and music with young learners, children, and adolescents. My teaching approach is thoughtfully crafted to accommodate the unique pace and learning style of each student, ensuring they not only master the technical skills but also cultivate a profound and lasting love for the art of music. I strive to create a supportive and inspiring environment where students feel encouraged to explore, express themselves, and grow as musicians."

## Global Perspective, Local Impact

Moving from Barcelona to Brussels has not only enriched my understanding of different musical traditions and cultures but has also shaped my approach to teaching piano. I now appreciate the importance of connecting with students in Brussels on a personal level, understanding their unique backgrounds, and fostering a love for music that resonates locally while embracing the global diversity of musical expression.

## Continuous Learning

Since starting my Bachelor in Music Performance at the Liceu Conservatory of Music in Barcelona in 2020, I have been dedicated to continuous learning under the guidance of esteemed musicians such as Josep María Colom Rincón and Vesko Stambolov. I’ve participated in masterclasses with notable artists like Edith Fisher, Eliane Reyes, the Elias String Quartet, and Akiko Ebi, which have greatly enriched my skills. My journey has included recitals in prominent Caracas concert halls, being a finalist in the XII National Piano Competition Silvia Eisenstein, and debuting as a Guest Soloist with the Municipal Orchestra of Caracas, performing Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 2. These experiences reflect my commitment to ongoing growth and excellence in my musical career.
